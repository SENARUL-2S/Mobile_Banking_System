Project Proposal: A Nagad Mobile Banking System

Introduction:
Nagad Mobile Banking System is a Java GUI application that aims to provide a convenient and
secure digital financial service for the customers of Nagad, a Bangladeshi mobile banking
platform. The application allows the users to perform various transactions such as cash-in, cashout, send money, pay bills, recharge mobile, and more. The application uses Swing, a part of Java
Foundation Classes (JFC), to create the graphical user interface components such as buttons, text
fields, labels, menus, etc. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design
pattern, which separates the data, presentation, and logic layers of the system. The application
is designed to be user-friendly, reliable, and secure.

Requirements:
Hardware requirements: None specific.
Software requirements: Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher, Java Swing & JavaFX etc.
Functional requirements:
❖ Code file should be able to Customer: Sign in with login and password.
❖ Code file should be able to view balance, transfer money, pay bill.
❖ Code file should be able to manage customers account, helpline and information.

Design and Implementation:
To design and implement your project, you need to follow some steps:
➢ First, you need to decide on the requirements and specifications of your project, such as
the features, functionalities, and user interface of your application.
➢ Second, you need to choose the appropriate GUI library for your project, such as AWT,
Swing, or JavaFX. Each library has its own advantages and disadvantages, so you need to
compare them and select the one that suits your needs.
➢ Third, you need to design the layout and appearance of your GUI components, such as
the buttons, text fields, labels, etc. You can use different layout managers, such as
BorderLayout, FlowLayout, or GridLayout, to arrange the components on the screen. You
can also use NetBeans IDE, which is a graphical tool that helps you create and design GUI
applications in Java.
➢ Fourth, you need to write the code for the logic and functionality of your application, such
as the event handling, cash-in, cash-out, send money, pay bills, recharge mobile, and
more. You can also use Maven, which is a tool that helps you manage the dependencies,
build, and deployment of your application.
➢ Fifth, you need to test and debug your application, and make sure it works as expected.
You can use various tools and techniques, such as breakpoints, logging, unit testing, and
exception handling, to find and fix the errors in your code.

Benefits of the project:
The Nagad Mobile Banking System provides a platform for real-time personalized Money
Management Insights, allows customers to conveniently and quickly pay any bill just by tapping
several buttons, customers can check their bank account balances, perform financial
transactions, deposit checks, and much more, avoiding the necessity to visit brick-and-mortar
financial and banking facilities and facilitating collaboration and teamwork in a variety of settings
etc. Some of the benefits of a mobile banking system project are:
▪ Convenience: Customers can perform various banking operations anytime and
anywhere, without visiting a branch or an ATM. They can also use features like
biometric authentication, voice commands, and chatbots to interact with the system
easily and securely.
▪ Cost-effectiveness: Banks can reduce their operational costs and staff expenses by
automating and streamlining their processes, such as account opening, transaction
processing, data management, reporting, etc. They can also save money on paper,
printing, and mailing by going digital.
▪ Innovation: Banks can leverage the latest technologies, such as cloud, AI, blockchain,
etc., to offer more value-added and differentiated services to their customers, such
as personalized financial advice, instant payments, loyalty programs, etc. They can
also collaborate with fintech partners and other external services to enhance their
offerings and competitiveness.

Challenges:
The Nagad Mobile Banking System need to ensure high performance, stability, and usability of
the services. It may also face competition and resistance from traditional banks and other
financial institutions that may have more established reputations and customer bases.
Limitations of the project:
The Nagad Mobile Banking System is simple and does not have many features beyond it need to
implement strong encryption, authentication, and verification mechanisms to protect the users’
data and transactions. It may face technical issues, such as network failures, system errors, bugs,
crashes and etc.

Future work:
The Nagad Mobile Banking System implementation is basic, but it can be extended to include
additional features such as improved customer experience and satisfaction, increased
operational efficiency and agility, enhanced innovation and competitiveness, user authentication
and encryption to improve its functionality and security.

Conclusion:
A Nagad Mobile Banking system project is a software application that simulates the operations
and services of a bank. It allows customers, tellers, and administrators to perform various tasks
such as opening accounts, transferring money, viewing transactions, managing user, etc. A user
interface that provides a friendly and secure way for users to interact with the system. A business
logic layer that implements the rules and validations for the banking operations and services. A
communication layer that enables the system to exchange data with other systems or services,
such as payment gateways, credit bureaus, etc.
